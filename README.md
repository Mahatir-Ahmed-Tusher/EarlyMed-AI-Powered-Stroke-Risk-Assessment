# EarlyMed: AI-Powered Stroke Risk Assessment üè•üß†

## Overview

**EarlyMed: AI-Powered Stroke Risk Assessment** is a side project of **EarlyMed**, an initiative by our team at **VIT-AP University** dedicated to empowering individuals with early health insights. Leveraging AI for early detection, our mission is simple: **"Early Detection, Smarter Decision."**

This project provides a predictive model for assessing stroke risk using machine learning. It estimates:
- **Binary Classification:** Whether a person is at risk of a stroke (Yes/No).
- **Regression Analysis:** The probability percentage of stroke occurrence.

Our goal is to help users make informed decisions before consulting a doctor.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this model is available on Kaggle: [Stroke Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahatiratusher/stroke-risk-prediction-dataset/data).

### üî¨ Features of the Dataset
Each record represents an individual‚Äôs medical condition, symptoms, and risk assessment.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Symptoms (Primary Predictors)
These binary features (1 = Present, 0 = Absent) significantly influence stroke risk:
- Chest Pain
- Shortness of Breath
- Irregular Heartbeat
- Fatigue & Weakness
- Dizziness
- Swelling (Edema)
- Pain in Neck/Jaw/Shoulder/Back
- Excessive Sweating
- Persistent Cough
- Nausea/Vomiting
- High Blood Pressure
- Chest Discomfort (Activity)
- Cold Hands/Feet
- Snoring/Sleep Apnea
- Anxiety/Feeling of Doom

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Target Variables (Predicted Outcomes)
- **At Risk (Binary):** 1 if the person is at risk of stroke, 0 otherwise.
- **Stroke Risk (%):** Estimated probability of stroke occurrence (0-100).

### üìú Dataset Generation Process
The dataset was created using medical literature, expert consultations, and statistical modeling. Feature distributions were inspired by real-world clinical observations to ensure validity.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### üîç **Functionality**
1. The user inputs their symptoms and medical details.
2. The model processes the inputs and predicts:
   - **Binary Classification:** Whether the user is at risk of stroke.
   - **Risk Percentage:** The likelihood of a stroke occurring.
3. The results help users understand their potential risk and take early action.

## üìä Model Performance & Results

## Regression Performance

### Random Forest (Regression)
| Metric                    | Value |
|---------------------------|-------|
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | 2.144 |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | 2.706 |
| R2 Score                  | 0.964 |

### XGBoost (Regression)
| Metric                    | Value |
|---------------------------|-------|
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | 1.076 |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | 1.350 |
| R2 Score                  | 0.991 |

### Discussion
- **XGBoost significantly outperforms Random Forest** in regression tasks, with a **lower MAE and RMSE**, indicating that it provides more precise predictions.
- The **R2 Score for XGBoost is 0.991**, showing that the model explains almost all the variance in stroke risk percentage, compared to **0.964 for Random Forest**.
